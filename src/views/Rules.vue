      CapeCraft is a server dedicated to keeping Minecraft's core aspect alive. We are a survival server where you'll be encouraged to work, trade and share with other players. CapeCraft is a survival server with No PVP, No Griefing and No Abuse of
      any type.
      We try to keep our server family friendly which is why we ask for no swearing and an English only chat on the server. All of our staff are friendly but firm and rule breakers will be swiftly dealt with.

      The community will thrive and develop into small communities each having their own village name and shops. Certain people will be in charge of each village and this will be entirely up to the people who run them. Players can start their own
      shops and
      villages just by building them and inviting people over, they can grow from there. All these villages will be player run and no commands will be used to set any villages up, nor will any ranks be given to players who own a village. Each village
      can
      have their own rules and it's completely up to the players to run and maintain them!

      Of course, there is always the option to live on your own, not in a village which is always as fun! You can just visit the public shop to buy/sell items and enjoy survival from there.
